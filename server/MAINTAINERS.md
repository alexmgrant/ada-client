## Maintainers Help

When we have a new version ready run the following script while at the repo root. WARNING this will remove any un-commited changes you may have made in the repository so ensure you commit them or are on master.

```
./scripts/package.sh
```

Which will generate the zip file that needs to be uploaded for candidates that does not include the solutions folder.
